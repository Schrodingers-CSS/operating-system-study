## 🎯 Goal

1. Understanding the principle of computer operation and program execution
2. Become familiar with computer terms
3. Before/after study each chapter, understand why I'm studying the chapter and the topics
4. Repetitive writing and striving for things I don't know or know ambiguous
5. Trying as hard as I can til the end 🙏🏼

## 🚨 Warn

Some of the images in Markdown are created on my own and **may differ from the facts**. Therefore, I ask for a reference only, and if there is something wrong or lacking information, I would really appreciate it if you give me comments/advices! 🙏🏼
Images created on my own are in the `src > img` folder in each chapter, and all textbooks and images for reference are uploaded in the `src > ref` folder.
